## My Assignments' Reflection

### Design Thinking Project

My time in the Technology Information and System (TIS) exposed me to theories with hands-on experiences. The Design Thinking project was a great exposure for me. It went beyond theoretical concepts, immersing in a hands-on process of solving real-world problems with creativity and user-centric solutions. Working collaboratively with a group of friends added a dynamic element, where diverse perspectives and brainstorming sessions turned challenges into opportunities. This experience not only taught me the practical application of Design Thinking but also enhanced my ability to work effectively in a team, changing ideas, collaboration, and the creation of solutions that bring goods to society.

### PC Installation Adventures

Messing around with PC installation was more than just putting pieces together. It taught me precision and the importance of paying attention to details. Sure, there were a couple of bumps in the road, but those moments added a human touch to the learning process, making it more practical.

### Clarity Techworks Internship

At Clarity Techworks, I got a taste of the lively Fintech world, learning stuff that jived with TIS principles. The focus on a skilled team, always learning, and using modern tools echoed what I'd been taught in TIS classes, making a clear connection between coursework and the real tech world.

### Indah Water's Research Center Visit

The visit to Indah Water's research center was a fascinating glimpse into the practical applications of software engineering in wastewater management. I witnessed firsthand how intricate systems, particularly the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, coordinate with electronic equipment like sensors to ensure effective wastewater treatment. This experience highlighted the pivotal role of software engineers in maintaining critical systems that impact public health and environmental safety.

### UTMDIGITAL Presentation

From the UTMDIGITAL presentation, I gained valuable insights into the University's digital ecosystem. Navigating through the UTM Data Centre unveiled the robust technological foundation supporting digital initiatives. Insights into various departments highlighted a comprehensive approach, addressing elements from user authentication to cloud services and internet security. This experience not only deepened my understanding of the role of technology in academic excellence but also offered practical insights into the management of a large-scale digital system, enriching my knowledge within the TIS field.

## Ready to Dive into the Tech World

In a nutshell, my TIS journey has been a mix of learning theories and getting hands-on. From Design Thinking projects focusing on human solutions to figuring out PC installation quirks, each step has deepened my TIS knowledge. Armed with these skills and a human touch, I'm ready to dive into the tech world and make a mark.
